        <h2> Sample Letter </h2>
        <h4> Dear Senator,
        <br />
        Did you know that in the past year, Boy Scouts were mentioned in the congressional record {{boy_mentions}} times, and Girl Scouts were mentioned {{girl_mentions}} times? I wanted to tell you about some of the accomplishments of my Girl Scout Troop, and to encourage you to recognize them! <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text-warning">[Tell them a bit about service projects, exciting activities, Gold Award projects, etc!]</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        I appreciate your service to our country, and thank you for your time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sincerely,
        <br />
        <span class="text-warning">[your name and troop number] </span>
